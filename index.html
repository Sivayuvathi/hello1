<h1>QUANTUM COMPUTING</h1>
<p>Quantum computing is a field of computer science that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than traditional computers</p>
<p>Quantum computers use specialized hardware to perform calculations that are based on the principles of quantum physics, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference</p>

<p>Quantum computing involves qubits.</p>
<p> Unlike a normal computer bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a multidimensional state.</p>
<p> The power of quantum computers grows exponentially with more qubits.</p>
<p> Classical computers that add more bits can increase power only linearly.</p>
